## Welcome!

Welcome to the Free and Accepted Masons – the home of Craft Freemasonry in Sweden. We welcome all honorable men who believe in a Supreme Being. Freemasonry is a moral system, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. It encourages us to think, to question, and to seek. It is a system of personal development in which members are inspired to examine their own values and shape their character. It is a path to freedom with responsibility, to self-knowledge, and to self-improvement.

Freemasonry has no political or religious affiliation, and it brings together men of different ages, backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs. In lodges throughout the  
country, we gather regularly to participate in ceremonies and traditions that  
foster openness, tolerance, and respect – inspiring us to take responsibility  
both as fellow human beings and as citizens.

In our lodges Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and other men of faith often meet side by side, all sharing the desire to grow – personally, morally, and spiritually. This diversity enriches our conversations and deepens our fellowship.

## The Free and Accepted Masons – District of Sweden

The District of Sweden is part of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Finland. It is a regular Masonic jurisdiction, recognized by both the United Grand Lodge of England and the Swedish Order of Freemasons. The District is led by the District Grand Master.

Today, four lodges of Free and Accepted Masons operate in Sweden:

*   [F. & A.M. Lodge Telge No. 169](/fnam/telge)
    
*   [F. & A.M. Lodge Donatus No. 174](/fnam/donatus)
    
*   [F. & A.M. Lodge Igelsta No. 175](/fnam/igelsta)
    
*   [F. & A.M. Lodge Aurelius No. 179](/fnam/aurelius)  
    

All lodge work is conducted in Swedish, according to a ritual from the late 18th century commonly known as Preston-Webb Workings, or “the American Ritual”. The ritual has existed in Swedish since 1923, when the first translation was completed in connection with the re-establishment of internationally recognized Freemasonry in Finland, supported at that time by the Grand Lodge of New York.

Our version of the ritual differs in several respects from the Anglo-Saxon form, not least through its musical enrichment with Jean Sibelius’ Musique religieuse, Op. 113, which was composed specifically for the ritual.
